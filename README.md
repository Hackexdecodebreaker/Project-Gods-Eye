    ```
2.  Install dependencies:

    *   (Optional) Update `app.py` secret keys if deploying publicly.

4.  Run the Server and Bot:
    *   Run `run_server.bat` (Starts Dashboard on http://localhost:5000)
    *   Run `run_bot.bat` (Starts Telegram Bot Listener)

### 2. Client Setup (The target)
**Option A: Developer Mode (Python)**
1.  Navigate to `client/`.
2.  Run `run_client.bat`.

**Option B: Standalone Executable (Recommended)**
1.  Run `build_client.bat` on your dev machine to generate the `.exe`.
2.  Copy `dist/GodsEyeAgent.exe` to the target machine.
3.  **Run `GodsEyeAgent.exe`**.
    *   **First Run**: A popup will ask for the **Server URL** (e.g., `http://YOUR_SERVER_IP:5000`).
    *   **Done**: The agent saves the config and installs itself to startup.
